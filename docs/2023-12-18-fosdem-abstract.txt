Command line workflow automation

The Neurospaces Workflow Automation Engine assists in the development
and automation of workflows based on system shell commands.  It
implements a hierarchy of project specific workflows and supports bash
completion to navigate them.  Separation of commands and configuration
enables the development of workflow roles and the creation of complex
workflows from simple ones.  These roles allow the integration of
workflows running on different physical and virtual machines and tmux
sessions.  Multi-role workflows can then be exported to one or more
shell scripts or color-coded role diagrams.  Using Git to version
control and distribute sets of project-specific workflows and their
help pages reduces startup time for new project collaborators.  This
presentation demonstrates several projects that were implemented with
the Neurospaces Workflow Automation Engine.

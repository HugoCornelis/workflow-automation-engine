# Target servers identify roles that execute command on different hosts.
# Each host has a 'remote_policy' that is prefixed to the command to be executed.
# For some roles the remote_policy is dynamically built.  A typical example is an remote ssh server.
#
# A role that has a 'localuser' set to 'yes' has no remote_policy.
#
# A tmux remote_policy requires its name to have a 'tmux_' prefix.
# This is recognized by the workflow engine and, for instance, allows tmux sessions to be automatically created.
#
# A docker remote_policy requires its name to have a 'docker_' prefix.
# This is recognized by the workflow engine and allows building Docker containers and associate them with a target.

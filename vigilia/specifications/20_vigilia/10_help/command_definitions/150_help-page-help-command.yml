          module-create        Create a new module with the given name.

comment: |+
  This type of comment element can be inserted at any level in the YAML files that define tests.
  
  For a concise example, see the second command definition that was generated with this one.
  
  The tests are defined with arrays of command definitions that each can have an array of command tests.
  
  Recognized key words at the level of the command definitions are (in alphabetical order):
  
  class: The name of a perl class that will execute the tests.
  command: The command the must be tested, with space seperated arguments and options.
  command_tests: An array of the tests executed against the command.
  disable: Gives the reason why this test command is disabled.
  description: A single line description of all the tests for the given command.
  error: Gives the reason why this test command will always fail.
  numerical_compare: Allow small arithmetic differences during the comparison of the expected result with the produced result.
  tag: An array of tags associated with this command.  These are matched with the tags given on the command line.

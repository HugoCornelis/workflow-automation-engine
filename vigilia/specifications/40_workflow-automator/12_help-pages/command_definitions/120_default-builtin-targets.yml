            A new workflow configuration is started with the command:
            
            .. code-block:: bash
               :linenos:
            
            workflow builtin project_start <project-name>
            
            This configuration is then installed in your local workspace (such as
            ``~/.local/bin``), with the command:
            
            .. code-block:: bash
               :linenos:
            
            workflow builtin configuration_install -- --commands --git

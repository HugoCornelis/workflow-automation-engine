      workflow: support for workflow design for embedded software engineers.
      
      SYNOPSIS
      
      workflow <options> <target> <command> -- < ... command specific options and arguments ... >
      
      EXAMPLES -- first try these with the --dry-run to understand what they do:
      
        $ workflow --help-targets                                       # display the available targets that are found in the configuration file.
      
        $ workflow --help-workflows                                     # display the workflows that are found in the configuration.
      
        $ workflow ssp build                                            # 'build' the 'ssp' target (if it exists for your local configuration).
      
        $ workflow --dry-run ssp build                                  # display the shell commands that would be executed to 'build' the 'ssp' target.
      
      options:
      
          --bash-completion               compute bash completion for the given command line.
                                          hint: the bash completion script implements completion for options, targets and operations.
          --details                       add more detailed output to --dry-run and --interactions* options (use this multiple times to increase the level of detail).
          --dry-run                       if set, do not execute system commands but print them to STDOUT if possible.
          --dump-all-interaction-roles    dump all the interaction roles found in the configuration.
          --dump-interaction-roles        dump the found interaction roles (note that they depend on the scheduled commands).
          --dump-module-interaction-roles dump all the interaction roles found in the module of the given command.
          --dump-schedule                 dump the constructed schedule to standard output without executing the scheduled commands.
          --interactive-execution-mode    set the interactive execution mode (default is: 'system').
          --export-help-page              export the help page of the command as comments to the shell script.
          --export-remote                 include the remote access part of exported commands.
                                          this option takes a number: 0 means all roles are exported, any other number exports only that respective role.
          --export-sh                     export the commands to a file with the given name.
          --export-sudo                   include applied sudo commands when exporting commands to a file.
          --export-times                  export the times when commands are started and ended to a file with the given name.
          --export-verbose                when exporting the commands to a file, interleave them with echo commands.
          --force-rebuild                 force a rebuild regardless of the existence and build date of previously built artefacts.
          --help                          display usage information and stop execution.
          --help-builtin-package          display help about the workflows of the given builtin package.
          --help-builtin-packages-all     display the builtin packages.
          --help-field-project-name       print the field project name and exit.
          --help-options                  print the option values.
          --help-projects                 display known project information and stop execution.
          --help-targets                  display known targets and stop execution.
          --help-workflows                display the configured workflows.
          --interactions                  show the interaction diagram of the commands.
          --interactions-all              show a diagram with all the commands and all the interaction roles.
          --interactions-target           show the interaction diagram of all the commands for the given target.
          --interactions-target-all-roles show the interaction diagram of the commands using all the found interaction roles in the configuration.
          --verbose                       set verbosity level.

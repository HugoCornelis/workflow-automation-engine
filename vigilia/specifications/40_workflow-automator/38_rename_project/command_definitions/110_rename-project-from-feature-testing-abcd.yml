      Bash completion can be enabled using:
      
      . ./abcd-bash-completion.sh
      
      Or / and maybe followed with a command to add or modify a first target, here, for the target named source_code:
      
      abcd-workflow builtin add_target source_code Operations on the source code, such as git checkout, build and installation. -- --install-commands-py

      Please update your /home/neurospaces/.bashrc to invoke the correct bash completion script.
      
      /home/neurospaces/projects/workflow-automation-engine/source/snapshots/master/vigilia/specifications/workflow-configurations/feature-testing abcd-bash-completion.sh
      
      And maybe also invoke in this shell: . /home/neurospaces/projects/workflow-automation-engine/source/snapshots/master/vigilia/specifications/workflow-configurations/feature-testing/abcd-bash-completion.sh

  class: The name of a perl class that will execute the tests.
  command: The command the must be tested, with space seperated arguments and options.
  command_tests: An array of the tests executed against the command.
  disable: Gives the reason why this test command is disabled.
  description: A single line description of all the tests for the given command.
  error: Gives the reason why this test command will always fail.
  numerical_compare: Allow small arithmetic differences during the comparison of the expected result with the produced result.
  tag: An array of tags associated with this command.  These are matched with the tags given on the command line.

      Bash completion can be enabled using:
      
      . ./feature-testing-bash-completion.sh
      
      Or/and maybe followed with a command to add or modify a first target, here, for the target named source_code:
      
      feature-testing-workflow builtin add_target source_code "Operations on the source code, such as git checkout, build and installation." -- --install-commands-py

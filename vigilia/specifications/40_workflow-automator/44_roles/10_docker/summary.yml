description: Testing of Docker based roles.
disabled: |+2

  Temporary disabling the role based tests.  They should be correct
  but some expected outputs don't match exactly with the generated
  outputs, it is currently unclear what the fix is.

  The problem could be related to this commit:

  5878f72 workflow: Fix the smoke test for line numbers.

  I am wondering why cut output with the line numbers removed, is a
  problem for this test but not for others.

  class:

      This class instantiates a docker image based on the given docker file, then runs a container based on that image.
      
      The name of image and the name of the container are controlled from the class properties.
      
      The class properties can include IP network information and IP address of the container.

      Created a configuration file for project 'workflow-tests'

      Test it with the command:
      
        workflow --help-field-project-name
      
      Afterwards install the configuration on your system by invoking the command:
      
        workflow builtin configuration_install -- --commands --git
      
      Then check if they work by inspecting the examples they provide (with various options):
      
        workflow-tests-workflow examples array_of_commands_remote_execution --interactions
      
        workflow-tests-workflow examples sequencing_and_composition --interactions-target
      
        workflow-tests-workflow examples single_command --dry-run
      
        workflow-tests-workflow examples array_of_commands --help
      
      To enable bash completion after installation of the scripts, either execute:
      
        . ~/.bashrc
      
      Or:
      
        . ./workflow-tests-bash-completion.sh

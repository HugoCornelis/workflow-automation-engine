    <h1>The Neurospaces Workflow Automation Engine</h1>

    The Neurospaces Workflow Automation Engine assists in the
    development and automation of project specific workflows based on
    system shell commands.

    Its main features are:

    <ul>
      <li> Bash completion: Use Bash completion to find your way through a hierarchy of project specific targets and commands.
      <li> Modularity: Compose complex workflows from simple ones and separate commands and configuration.
      <li> Roles: Implement workflows on different physical and virtual machines, tmux sessions and other accounts, then integrate them.
      <li> Export: Export your sophisticated workflows as a single shell script to be used by others.
      <li> Colors: Explore role diagrams of your workflows color coded according to your project specific settings.
      <li> Collaboration: Use a common git repository to share project workflows between colleagues.
      <li> Coherence: Your documented developer workflows are the workflows you use for development.
    </ul>

    The benefits of using the Neurospaces Workflow Engine:

    <ul>
      <li> Reduced ramp up time: New colleagues have immediate access to hierarchically organized workflows and their configuration.
      <li> Persistence: Never forget about that complicated command that you used to 'flash your device'.
      <li> Structure: Group related workflows in workflow modules and namespaces.
      <li> Auto-exploration: The workflows of your projects become self-documenting.
    </ul>

    Enjoy your workflows.

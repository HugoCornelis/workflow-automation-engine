    The Neurospaces Harness automates unit, regression, integration and
    smoke testing.  Declarative test specifications define application
    behaviour and can be executed to validate application behaviour
    against its specifications.
    
    Command line options support extraction of documentation at various
    levels of detail or for specific application functions.  Test
    specifications can be converted either to a list of commands with test
    input or to HTML or Latex to create a comprehensive series of manuals.
    
    Used this way test specifications are an application knowledge base
    that guarantee correct application behaviour.

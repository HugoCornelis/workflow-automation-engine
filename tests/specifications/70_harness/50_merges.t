The Neurospaces Harness allows test specifications to be merged.

Partial (incomplete) test specifications address the need for the
separation of high-level requirement description from intermediary
level function description and low-level testing of an implementation
against requirement and description.

The subsequent merge of the partial test specifications creates a
complete set of test specifications that can be run by the Neurospaces
Harness.
